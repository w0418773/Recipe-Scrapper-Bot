🍳 Recipe Scrapper Bot
<br/><br/>
This project was inspired by a common everyday problem: having a few random ingredients at home, but no idea what to cook with them. Whether you're trying to use up what's in your fridge or just avoid a trip to the grocery store, it can be frustrating to figure out what recipes are even possible with what you already have.

The goal of this app is to solve that problem.


With this program, you can simply enter a list of ingredients you have on hand (e.g., "chicken, rice, broccoli"), and it will automatically search for recipes that use those ingredients. Behind the scenes, the app queries a recipe website, filters the results, and returns a selection of meal ideas that match your input.

Each recipe suggestion includes:

✅ The name of the recipe

🌐 A direct link to the full instructions

🧂 A list of required ingredients

You can scroll through multiple recipe options to find one that works best for you, all without needing to manually browse recipe websites or guess which meals are possible.
